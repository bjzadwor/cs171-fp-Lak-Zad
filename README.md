CS171 Final Project

The visualization for this project exists in the cs171-fp-Lak-Zad/vis folder.  The html file you need to look at is called fp.html.  We will eventually add an index.html which will hold the additional information necessary for this project.  This project is also hosted at http://www.zadworney.com/z/vis/fp.html .   This visualization still takes a little time to load when viewed online.  We are working to break the data set up into smaller regional segments which will make the page load quicker.  I also have caching turned off on the server, this makes it easier to test the online speeds as we shrink the data-set.
