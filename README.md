CS171 Final Project  Bryan Zadworney & Bijish N Lakshmanan

The visualization for this project exists in the cs171-fp-Lak-Zad/vis/ folder.  The html file you need to look at is called fp.html.
This visualization still takes a little time to load when viewed online.

Global Mortality Dashboard
Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation -- Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD)
"The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) is a systematic, scientific effort by a collaborative of researchers worldwide to quantify the comparative magnitude of health loss to diseases, injuries, and risk factors by age, sex, and geography over time." "The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IMHE) at the University of Washington is an independent research center identifying the best strategies to build a healthier world. By measuring health, tracking program performance, finding ways to maximize health system impact, and developing innovative measurement systems, IHME provides a foundation for informed decision-making that ultimately will lead to better health for people worldwide."

Project Goals
This site was developed by Bijish N Lakshmanan and Bryan Zadworney as their final project for CS171 - Visualization at Harvard University. The site was developed in an effort to examine how causes of mortality vary by region, age, and sex. Our main goal was to visualize how people die, particularly looking at where they live affects how and when they die. In order to account for the differences in population size between the regions we chose to normalize data to 100,000 people in each population set.
